# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.

  - trigger: ":dump"
    replace: "Rewrite this conversation as a chronological markdown transcript with roles and messages preserved."

  - trigger: ":summ"
    replace: "Summarize this entire conversation as a structured brief preserving key decisions, assumptions, and open questions."

  - trigger: ":done"

  # Meeting minutes — transform raw input into structured executive minutes
  - trigger: ":minutes"
    replace: |
      You are a professional executive assistant and documentation specialist.

      Your task is to transform the provided input into structured, formal meeting minutes.

      Follow these rules strictly:

      1. Use a professional, clean, executive format.
      2. Infer missing structure when necessary (e.g., agenda, decisions, action items).
      3. If a date is not provided, use today's date.
      4. If attendees are not explicitly listed, extract names from the content when possible.
      5. Convert messy notes, transcripts, or fragmented ideas into clear, structured language.
      6. Remove filler words and conversational noise.
      7. Highlight decisions and action items clearly.
      8. Use concise, precise, and factual language.

      Format the output exactly as follows:

      ------------------------------------------------------------

  # Deep, thoughtful, print-ready document prompt (full version)
  - trigger: ":deepwrite"
    replace: |
      I want you to act as a **senior technical strategist and document architect**.

      My goal is **not** a summary, paraphrase, or stitched-together response. I want a **cohesive, original, well-reasoned document** that integrates my ideas, fills in gaps using your expertise, and presents a clear argument.

      **Key requirements:**

      1. **Think first, write second**
         * Before generating the document, internally reason about structure, flow, and the core thesis.
         * Do not jump directly into summarization or bullet condensation.
      2. **Preserve and expand all important ideas**
         * Do not drop concepts unless I explicitly ask you to.
         * If ideas imply second-order effects (cost, scaling, incentives, trade-offs), make them explicit.
      3. **Add missing but necessary content**
         * Use your domain knowledge to fill conceptual gaps, assumptions, and implications.
         * Clearly connect causes → effects → strategic consequences.
      4. **Produce a print-ready, professional document**
         * Use clear sectioning, short paragraphs, and compact tables where appropriate.
         * Optimize for A4 / PDF readability (not chat UI).
      5. **Tables must complement the narrative**
         * Tables should be compact, information-dense, and referenced by surrounding text.
         * Do not offload reasoning into tables without explanation.
      6. **Tone and audience**
         * Assume the reader is technical and strategic (e.g., founders, architects, investors).
         * Avoid hype; favor clarity, trade-offs, and systems thinking.
      7. **Do not over-compress**
         * Do not collapse multi-step arguments into a single paragraph.
         * If a concept deserves space, give it space.

      **Output format:**
      * A structured document suitable for direct export to PDF
      * Section headers, concise paragraphs, and minimal but precise bullet lists
      * If useful, include multiple compact tables instead of one large table

      I will now provide the raw ideas, notes, or rough explanation.
      Your task is to turn them into a **coherent, high-quality document**, not a summary.

  # Ultra-short version (when you're in a hurry)
  - trigger: ":rewrite"
    replace: |
      Turn my notes into a **print-ready, professional document**.
      Do **not** summarize or omit ideas.
      Think deeply about structure, implications, and second-order effects.
      Fill in missing reasoning using your expertise.
      Optimize layout for A4/PDF with compact tables and clear sections.

  # Capture agent session as structured Markdown doc
  - trigger: ":recordit"
    replace: |
      Capture the entire conversation in this agent session and generate a well-structured Markdown document.

      Requirements:
      - Include:
        - High-level purpose of the discussion
        - Key decisions made
        - Important technical details, designs, or reasoning
        - Open questions, risks, or TODOs
      - Preserve important code snippets exactly as discussed
      - Do NOT invent new content; only summarize what was actually discussed

      Output:
      - Create a Markdown file named:
        Docs/<descriptive-title>.md
      - Use clear Markdown structure:
        - Title
        - Sections with headings
        - Bullet points where appropriate
        - Code blocks where needed

      Action:
      - Write the file directly into the repository

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
