# espanso match file
# SOURCE OF TRUTH — do not overwrite from backup/restore. To edit: chmod u+w base.yml

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.

# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espanso/espanso/dev/schemas/match.schema.json

matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  - trigger: ":dump"
    replace: "Rewrite this conversation as a chronological markdown transcript with roles and messages preserved."

  - trigger: ":summ"
    replace: "Summarize this entire conversation as a structured brief preserving key decisions, assumptions, and open questions."

  - trigger: ":done"
    replace: "update progress.md, commit and push"

  - trigger: ":linkit"
    replace: "make it source of truth and replace the original one with a symbolic link to this file"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
